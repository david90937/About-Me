Hello! My name is David, and I am a young professional looking to build a skill set in programming. I started learning how to program in C# by following the Udemy course "Learn to Code by Making Games - the Complete Unity Developer Course". I completed the 2D portion (~55%) of the course prior to switching to a more generalized focus, as I felt I may be missing out on some general best practices in lieu of more specified Unity knowledge.

Currently, I am looking to take what I learned with Unity and convert it into a more general programming foundation based in web-development to launch my career with. I am working through the Free Code Camp, https://learn.freecodecamp.org/, curriculum currently. While I work through the curriculum and projects, I will be using CodePen and my Free Code Camp profile for providing updates on my learning journey.
